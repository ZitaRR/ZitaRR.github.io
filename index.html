                Gaming has always been a big part of my life and as a kid I was intrigued by it.
                 <br>
                How could something so small as a press of a button have such a major impact on the TV-screen?
                <br><br>
                Since then I've always been fascinated about game-development and it's also the reason as to why I got into programming.
                <br>
                During my time in upper secondary school, I studied game-development and I got introduced to the game engine <i>Unity3D</i>.
                <br>
                Though it has its' flaws it was a perfect fit for me.
                <br><br>
                .NET and C# was my first set of tools I used when I got into programming and therefore I have a weak spot for them. With that said though;
                <br>
                I love to learn new things too and I'm always up for a new challenge, regardless of how daunting it might be!
